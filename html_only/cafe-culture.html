      <h2>What is coffee culture?</h2>
      <p>
      When people think about coffee in Canada, they often think about ordering
      a double-double at Tim Hortons. But coffee culture is much more than
      stock-standard drip coffee. Ten years ago it would have been hard to find
      any semblance of coffee culture in cities like Toronto beyond the
      ubiquitous Starbucks, but things have now changed. Cities like Toronto
      and Montreal are festooned with unique, boutique cafe's serving up
      barista-styled coffee drinks, and possibly home-made patisserie and treats.
      Much of this stems from a need to look beyond fast-coffee, and the
      establishment of numerous in-house roasteries, developing their own
      coffee bean profiles. Coffee also transcends different societies, from
      Italian, to Turkish, to Lebanese, to Japanese. Coffee culture is about the
      coffee bean, but it is just as much about the person making the coffee,
      the quality of the ingredients, and even the texhnique used. Espresso
      machines, siphon coffee, Moka pot, V60, or Ibrik all produce differing
      renditions of coffee.
